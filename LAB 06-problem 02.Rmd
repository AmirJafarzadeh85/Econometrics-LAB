#i 
lm1 <- lm (log(salary) ~ log(sales) + log(mktval), data= dt.salaries)
stargazer(lm1 , type = "text")

##Results: log(salary)= 4.621 + 0.162*log(sales) +  0.107*log(mktval)
###B2 and B3 which are coeeficients of slae and mktval are significant in 0.01 and 0.05 respectively. 

#ii 

lm2 <- lm (log(salary) ~ log(sales) + log(mktval) + profits, data= dt.salaries)
stargazer(lm2 , type = "text")

##Results: log(salary)= 4.687 +   0.161*log(sales) +  0.098*log(mktval) +   0.00004*profits
###B2 and B3 and b4 which are coeeficients of slae and mktval and profits are significant in 0.05 and 0.1 and 0.01 respectively. 
###because there are some firms with negative profit, profits cannot be included in logarithmic form. 

##iii 
###once the mktval increases 100%, then the salaries of CEOs increase 9.8%. 
###yes, since std of it is (0.064), so it is significant in the significant level of 0.1 


##iv
###once the profits increases 100%, then the salaries of CEOs increase 0.04%. 
###yes, since std of it is (0.0002), so it is significant in the significant level of 0.01 

##v 
lm3 <- lm (log(salary) ~ log(sales) + log(mktval) + profits + ceoten+ comten, data= dt.salaries)
stargazer(lm3 , type = "text")
###Since the coeficient of ceotensq is 0.017, so once ceoten increases 1%, the salaries increase 1.7%. 

##vi) the coeficients of ceoten and comten are 0.017 and -0.010 respectively which means that 1% increases in ceoten, can increase ceoten 1.7 and decrease comten 1% 

##vii) since the coefficient of comten is negative, since if comten increases which means longer tenure with the company, the salaries decrease. 


##viii) 
 new.salar <- data.table(sales=6200, mktval=23200, profits=966, ceoten=2, comten=9)
 new.salar
 my.pred <- predict(lm3, newdata = new.salar)
 my.pred

 ## whith this methid, we should calculat one by one. 
ft.val <- fitted.values(lm3)
ft.val

###it can show the results of all salaries 



##ix 
summary(lm3)
summary (lm3)$r.squared 
## so the R2 would be  0.3490874

##x
res.salar <- residuals(lm3)
res.salar  ##calculation of the Residuals

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
